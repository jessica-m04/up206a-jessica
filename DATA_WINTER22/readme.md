# DATA OVERVIEW
The two datasets below are from Los Angeles Open Data. This website is a repository for any and all data that pertains to the city and its agencies. The datasets I've chosen are related to owner-occupied homes in LA.

## 2020 and 2021 Registered Foreclosure Properties

put name of dataset in square brackets then put in link to the dataset

This dataset is a list of all the properties that went into foreclosure in 2020 and 2021. It provides the registered date of forecloure, property type, location (latitude and longitude) and  street address, the name of the lender and many other data points. This dataset will be useful in identifying where foreclosure rates in the city are the highest. I am thinking this data could also be cross-checked on sites liked ZIMAS or Zillow to discover if they have been been bought or are back on the market. I think it would be interesting to compare the years of the financial collapse to the 2020 and 2021 Covid-19 pandemic.

## Building and Safety Code Enforcement

This dataset provides a list of all the code violation cases open in LA dating back to 2014. It includes the address, case status, type of code violation and the date the case was open and closed. I am interested in viewing the types of code violation district and possibly by neighborhood.
