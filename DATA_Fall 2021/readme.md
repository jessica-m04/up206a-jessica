# DATA OVERVIEW
The two datasets below are from Los Angeles Open Data. This website is a repository for any and all data that pertains to the city and its agencies. The datasets I've chosen are about affordable housing units and where they can be found in the city.

## LAHD Affordable Housing Project List


[LAHD Affordable Housing Project List](https://data.lacity.org/Housing-and-Real-Estate/LAHD-Affordable-Housing-Projects-List-2003-to-Pres/mymu-zi3s)


This data is a list of all affordable housing project funded by LAHCID (formerly LAHD) from 2003 to the present. It gives the name of each project, its address, location (latitude and longitude), amount of funding each project has recieved and many other data points. This dataset will be useful in identifying where the affordable housing units are located. We plan on crossing this list with data that shows where the parks are located in the city to determine proximity to parks and green space for affordable housing residents.

## Total and Affordable Housing Units


[Total and Affordable Housing Units](https://data.lacity.org/Housing-and-Real-Estate/Total-and-Affordable-Housing-Units/rckt-8prm)


This data set gives an annual review of all the affordable housing units produced in the City of Los Angeles. Each row is a fiscal year and then columns are each quarter's production of affordable units. The data is meant to track the progress towards Mayor Garcetti's goal of permitting 100,000 new affordable units from the start of his term through the end of fiscal year 2021. I don't believe this dataset will be very helpful for our project but it is useful to see the number of affordable housing units actually being permitted and built over the past 6 years.
