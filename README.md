I am a 2nd Year MURP concentrating in CEDH and D+D with a focus on housing policy and research. From what I understand, this course is about learning how use data to tell stories by creating interesting and useful visual and interactive maps. <br>
Project Ideas: This is my 2nd time taking this course and I am no longer at a loss as to what to do for a project! I am hoping to do something related to sundown towns but am open to other ideas related to housing and immigration. <br>
Objectives: To learn new skills to make me a better researcher, analyst and future policy-maker. <br>
