# DATA OVERVIEW
The two datasets below are from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. This website is for a government agency that "implements and enforces Federal consumer financial law". That said, the datasets I've chosen are a part of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act.  .

This data is a list of all affordable housing project funded by LAHCID (formerly LAHD) from 2003 to the present. It gives the name of each project, its address, location (latitude and longitude), amount of funding each project has recieved and many other data points. This dataset will be useful in identifying where the affordable housing units are located. We plan on crossing this list with data that shows where the parks are located in the city to determine proximity to parks and green space for affordable housing residents.
